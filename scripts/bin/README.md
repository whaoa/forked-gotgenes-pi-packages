# scripts/bin — PATH shims

This directory contains shim scripts that intercept forbidden CLI commands and redirect developers (and agents) to the correct alternative.

`scripts/bin` is prepended to PATH for all sessions within the project directory via `[env] _.path` in `mise.toml`.
This activates automatically for any shell or agent session where mise is active and the working directory is under the repo.

## Shims

|Command|Redirects to|Rationale|
|-------|------------|---------|
|`npm`|`pnpm`|This project uses pnpm exclusively. npm must never be used — it ignores `pnpm-lock.yaml` and can corrupt the lockfile.|

### npm shim pass-throughs

|Pattern|Reason|
|-------|------|
|`npm root`|The extension calls `npm root -g` at startup to discover the global `node_modules` directory where Pi installs skills and extensions.|
|`npm ... --prefix */.pi/npm`|Pi itself runs `npm install --prefix <project>/.pi/npm` to manage extensions and skills. These are Pi-internal operations, not developer misuse.|

All other npm subcommands are blocked.

## Adding a new shim

1. Create a new executable script in this directory named after the forbidden command.
2. The script must exit with a non-zero exit code.
3. Print a clear error message to stderr identifying the correct alternative.
4. Detect subcommands where possible and provide a specific suggestion.
5. Add the new entry to the table above.

## Emergency bypass

If you genuinely need to run the real `npm` binary (e.g., for debugging the shim itself):

```bash
$(mise where node)/bin/npm --version
```
