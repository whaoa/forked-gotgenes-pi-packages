## Monorepo Structure

This is a pnpm workspace monorepo.
Each package under `packages/` is a Pi extension published to npm under `@gotgenes/`.
Always launch Pi from the repo root — the root `.pi/settings.json` and `.pi/prompts/` are only discovered from CWD.
Before working on a specific package, load its `package-<name>` skill for architecture, priorities, and testing context.

## Workflow

- Keep scope tight.
- Prefer small, reversible changes.
- Preserve intentional behavior unless there is a clear reason to change it.
- Ask before removing functionality or changing defaults.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript.
- Avoid `any` unless absolutely necessary.
- Use standard top-level imports only.
- Keep modules focused and composable (one concern per file).
- Prefer explicit configuration over hidden behavior.
- This project uses **pnpm** exclusively — never `npm` or `npx`.
- The tsconfig target is ES2024 (`noEmit: true`).
  ES2023 APIs (`findLast`, `findLastIndex`, `toReversed`, `toSorted`, `toSpliced`, `with`) and ES2024 APIs (`Promise.withResolvers`, `Object.groupBy`, `Map.groupBy`, `Array.fromAsync`) are available and preferred.
  Do not use APIs introduced after ES2024.

Before implementing, refactoring, or reviewing code, load the `code-design` skill for design principles and structural heuristics.

## Markdown

- Use one sentence per line (unbroken) for better diffs.
- Always specify a language on fenced code blocks (e.g., ` ```typescript `, ` ```bash `, ` ```text `); use `text` for plain output.
- Use sequential numbering (`1.` `2.` `3.`) in ordered lists, restarting at `1.` under each new heading — markdownlint's MD029 rejects continued numbering across section boundaries.
- Do not use bold text (`**...**`) as a substitute for headings — use proper heading syntax; markdownlint's MD036 rejects emphasis used as headings.
- When embedding markdown that itself contains fenced code blocks, use a 4-backtick outer fence (` ````markdown `).
- Use compact table style — markdownlint's MD060 enforces consistent column style.
- Separate adjacent blockquotes with an HTML comment (`<!-- -->`) to satisfy markdownlint's MD028.

Before writing or editing markdown files, load the `markdown-conventions` skill.

## Mermaid

Before authoring or reviewing Mermaid diagrams, load the `mermaid` skill.

## Documentation Frontmatter

Docs under `docs/plans/` and `docs/retro/` use YAML frontmatter for structured metadata.
GitHub renders it as a table at the top of the file.

Schema (both fields are strings/numbers — quote any title containing backticks or colons):

```yaml
---
issue: 14                                              # optional: omit for plans that predate issue tracking
issue_title: "Batch-by-default formatter dispatch"     # required
---
```

- `issue` stores the number only, never a URL.
- Do not duplicate frontmatter fields as inline metadata in the body.
- Other doc types (`README.md`) do not use frontmatter.

## Testing

Before writing or debugging tests, load the `testing` skill for Vitest mock patterns and TDD planning rules.

## Commits

Use Conventional Commits.
Commit at meaningful checkpoints without waiting for an explicit reminder.
Prefer small, reviewable commits that leave the repository in a valid state.
Do not edit `CHANGELOG.md` — release-please owns it.
