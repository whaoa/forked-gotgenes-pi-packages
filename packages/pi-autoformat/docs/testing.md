# Testing

`pi-autoformat` ships three layers of tests:

1. Unit tests under `test/*.test.ts` — fast, hermetic, cover individual modules (config loader, formatter executor, prompt autoformatter, shell mutation detector, etc.).
2. Acceptance tests that spawn the real `pi` CLI in `--mode rpc` — covered below.
3. (Future) LLM-gated acceptance tests — designed but not yet implemented.

Run everything with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Vitest does not type-check.
For type-only changes use:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

## Acceptance tests

Files: `test/acceptance.test.ts`, `test/acceptance-event-bus.test.ts`, `test/fallback-acceptance.test.ts`.

Acceptance tests spawn the real `pi` binary in `--mode rpc` and assert behavior against actual Pi runtime events.
They catch regressions that pure unit tests cannot: extension load failures, payload-shape drift on real Pi events, and EventBus contract drift.

### Resolving the `pi` binary

`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` is a `devDependency` of this package, and `pnpm install` produces a working `node_modules/.bin/pi`.
The shared harness in `test/helpers/rpc.ts` resolves `pi` from that path explicitly rather than relying on the global `PATH`:

```typescript
export const PI_BIN = resolve("node_modules/.bin/pi");
export const piAvailable = existsSync(PI_BIN);
```

Benefits:

- CI runs the acceptance suite under the existing `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` step — no workflow changes needed.
- The Pi version is pinned by `pnpm-lock.yaml`, so CI and local runs use the same binary.
- Contributors who ran `pnpm install` get the acceptance suite for free; no separate global install.

### Skip semantics

`describeIfPi` is a safety net: it skips when `node_modules/.bin/pi` is missing (for example, after a partial checkout without `pnpm install`).
In normal usage every contributor runs the full suite.

### Test fixtures

`test/fixtures/` holds small companion extensions and helpers used by the acceptance suite:

- `event-bus-emitter.ts` — registers `/emit-touched <path...>` and forwards the paths onto the `autoformat:touched` channel via `pi.events.emit`.
- `formatter-recorder.mjs` — a stand-in "formatter" that appends `{ argv, cwd }` to the file pointed at by the `PI_AUTOFORMAT_RECORDER_LOG` env var.
  Tests configure this script as the formatter command and read the log to assert what Pi actually invoked.

### EventBus acceptance test

`test/acceptance-event-bus.test.ts` exercises the production extension's `pi.events` subscription end to end:

1. Writes a project config that wires the recorder formatter to `.ts` files and sets `formatMode: "session"` so the flush runs on session shutdown.
2. Loads `src/extension.ts` and `event-bus-emitter.ts` together via `-e` flags.
3. Sends `{ type: "prompt", message: "/emit-touched <path>" }` over RPC.
4. Closes stdin; `session_shutdown` triggers the flush.
5. Reads the recorder log and asserts the formatter ran on the emitted absolute path.

This test is the primary safeguard against EventBus payload-shape drift between this extension and Pi.

## What is *not* covered by the default suite

Several scenarios named in issue #10 are not in the default acceptance suite because Pi's RPC mode does not surface the events they depend on:

- **`bash` shell mutation.**
  Pi's RPC `bash` command stores a `BashExecutionMessage` for the next prompt's LLM context but does not emit `tool_call` or `tool_result` events.
  Our extension's snapshot tracker is wired to those events, so an RPC `bash` command does not drive the shell-mutation path.
  Coverage today: `test/shell-mutation-detector.test.ts` (unit).
- **`write` / `edit` payload-shape validation.**
  These tools are only invoked by the LLM; there is no documented non-LLM trigger.
  Coverage today: `test/extension.test.ts` (integration with a stubbed `ExtensionAPI`).
- **`customMutationTools` real `tool_result` events.**
  Same constraint as `write`/`edit`: the registered tool only fires when an LLM calls it.
  Coverage today: `test/custom-mutation-tools.test.ts` (unit).

These gaps are real but bounded.
The unit / integration tests pin the handler logic; the EventBus acceptance test pins the runtime wiring; LLM-gated tests (below) will eventually pin the tool-result payload contract.

## LLM-gated acceptance suite (future)

The natural way to drive `bash` / `write` / `edit` / `customMutationTools` end to end is to send a real `prompt` and let an LLM call the tool.
That is intentionally out of scope for default `pnpm test`:

- requires a provider API key,
- costs money,
- is non-deterministic.

When implemented, these tests will live under `test/acceptance-llm/` and skip unless `PI_AUTOFORMAT_LLM_TESTS=1` is set in the environment plus the relevant provider credential (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).
They will not run in default CI; an explicit, manually triggered workflow may run them on a schedule.
