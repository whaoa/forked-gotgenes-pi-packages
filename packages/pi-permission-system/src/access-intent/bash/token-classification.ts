/**
 * Pure, synchronous token-classification helpers for bash path extraction.
 *
 * Exports three classifiers consumed by `bash-path-resolver.ts`:
 *   - `classifyTokenAsPathCandidate` — strict gate for the external-directory guard.
 *   - `classifyTokenAsRuleCandidate` — broader gate for cross-cutting `path` rules.
 *   - `classifyPromotedRuleCandidate` — rule-driven promotion of a bare filename
 *     (e.g. `id_rsa`) that `classifyTokenAsRuleCandidate` rejects for shape, but
 *     which matches an active, specific (non-`*`) `path` deny/ask rule (#509).
 *
 * All three classifiers share the private `rejectNonPathToken` predicate that
 * captures the seven rejection cases common to them (the production clone this
 * module was extracted to eliminate).
 *
 * Both `classifyTokenAsPathCandidate` and `classifyTokenAsRuleCandidate` recognize
 * Windows drive-letter absolute paths (`C:/…`, `C:\…`) unconditionally on all
 * platforms. On POSIX the token resolves as a real in-CWD relative path and is
 * gated by the `path` surface; on Windows the `PathNormalizer` routes it through
 * the absolute-path branch. Shape recognition is platform-independent string
 * matching; the platform-sensitive absoluteness decision belongs to `PathNormalizer`.

 * patterns). This classifier promotes a bare token into the rule-candidate
 * surface only when the caller-supplied `isPromotable` predicate says it
 * matches an active, specific `path` deny/ask rule, closing the bypass without
 * treating every bare argument as a path.
 *

 * env-assignment, URL, `@scope` token, or regex-shaped token is never
 * promoted even if it happens to match a configured pattern.
