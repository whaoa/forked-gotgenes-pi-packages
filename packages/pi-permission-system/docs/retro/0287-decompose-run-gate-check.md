# Retro: #287 — Thin `runGateCheck` via a `SessionApproval` value object and `SessionRules.record`

## Stage: Planning (2026-05-31T00:00:00Z)

### Session summary

Planned the decomposition of `runGateCheck` in `src/handlers/gates/runner.ts`.
The plan rejects the issue's original "extract three phase helpers" approach as procedure-splitting and instead targets the real design smells: a behaviorless `sessionApproval` union, the runner doing the session store's bookkeeping scalar-by-scalar, and duplicated decision-event construction.
The committed plan introduces a `SessionApproval` value object, a `SessionRules.record(approval)` tell that absorbs the per-pattern loop, and a pure `buildDecisionEvent` helper; `runGateCheck` thins as a consequence.
Issue #287 was amended (title + body) to match this framing.

### Observations

- The user drove a Socratic redesign across several rounds, rejecting in turn: (1) the three free helpers (`emitSessionHit`/`recordSessionApprovals` are side-effect-only relocations), (2) exported helpers + unit tests (mock-call assertions duplicate the integration suite), and (3) a `GateEvaluation` command object ("two methods and one is a constructor — a function in a class trenchcoat"; the per-call evaluation is transient, not stateful).
- The converged insight: the genuinely stateful object is `SessionRules` (lives for the session, queried + mutated), and the missing value object is `SessionApproval` (the `{ pattern } | { patterns }` union interrogated in both phase 3 and phase 6).
  Tell-Don't-Ask = tell the store to `record(approval)`; let the value object own the union.
- Key scope decision: this reshapes internal seams (`GateRunnerDeps.approveSessionRule` → `recordSessionApproval`, `GateDescriptor.sessionApproval` → `SessionApproval`, `PermissionSession`, `SessionRules`) and all five gate producers + ~8 deps-mock test files.
  Wider than the issue's original "internal decomposition," so the issue was amended rather than silently exceeded.
- `applyPermissionGate` / `permission-gate.ts` deliberately kept unchanged — it retains its single `{ surface; pattern }` seam and the runner adapts via `SessionApproval.toGateApproval()`.
  This contains the blast radius.
- Lift-and-shift chosen for the test churn: keep `SessionRules.approve(surface, pattern)` as the internal primitive so `session-rules.test.ts` is not rewritten; the type-forced cutover (descriptor type + deps reshape) is one mechanical commit because TypeScript breaks every producer, the runner, and every deps-mock simultaneously.
- The original first draft of the plan (the rejected three-helper version) was overwritten in place before commit, so only the converged plan is in history.
- Deferred to Open Questions: lifting phase-1 check resolution onto the descriptor — revisit only if `fallow` still flags `runner.ts` after step 3.
