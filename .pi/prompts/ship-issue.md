# Ship the implementation

Argument: `$1` is the issue number that was just implemented.

Fetch the issue title via `gh issue view $1 --json title -q .title`, then call `set_session_name` with name `#$1 Ship — <issue title>` to identify this session in the session selector.

## Release coordination (decide before step 1)

Gather the release decision up front, from a deterministic source, **before** any irreversible work (`git pull`/push/CI).
A decision presented early from the plan is far less likely to be reversed than one inferred from prose at the cancel point.

1. Locate the plan for this issue: `grep -rl "^issue: $1$" docs/plans packages/*/docs/plans`.
2. If a plan is found, read its `**Release:**` marker (written by `/plan-issue`):
   - A marker containing `mid-batch — defer` → ask the operator **now**: defer the release (batch until the sequence completes), or release anyway?
     Record the decision.
   - Any other `**Release:**` value (`ship independently` or `ship now — batch "<name>" tail`) → record "release now"; note the recommendation in the final report; do **not** ask.
   - No `**Release:**` marker → record "release now" (default); do **not** ask.
3. If no plan file is found → record "release now" (default); do **not** ask.

This section only reads the plan and (conditionally) asks — it performs no git, push, or CI action.
Step 4b applies the recorded decision.

## 1. Sync with remote

Before pushing, make sure local `HEAD` is current with the remote:

1. Run `git pull --ff-only`.
2. If it fails for **any** reason — uncommitted changes, divergent history, merge conflict, network error, detached HEAD — stop immediately and report the failure to the user.
   Do not attempt to stash, rebase, force, or otherwise resolve.
3. Only proceed once the pull reports a clean fast-forward (or `Already up to date.`).

## 2. Pre-push checks

Run from the **repo root** (not a package subdirectory):

1. `pnpm run lint` — catches cross-package lint violations CI runs at root level; package-level `pnpm run lint` may miss sibling-package issues.
2. `pnpm fallow dead-code` — CI runs this gate on every `main` push (not on PRs), so a pre-existing failure blocks your push regardless of whether this issue introduced it.

If either fails, fix the issues and commit before pushing.

## 3. Push

- Determine the current branch (`git branch --show-current`).
- `git push`.
- If the push is rejected as non-fast-forward, stop and report — do not force-push.

## 4. Verify CI on the pushed commit

1. Run `git rev-parse HEAD` to capture the full 40-char SHA.
   Pass that exact value to `ci_find` — never hand-expand the short SHA from the `git push` output, and never type a SHA from memory.
2. Use `ci_find` with that SHA and workflow `ci` to locate the CI run.
3. Use `ci_watch` with the returned `run_id` and workflow `ci` to wait for it to complete.
4. If the run conclusion is `failure`, stop and report.
   Do not close the issue or merge anything.
5. If it lands `success`, continue.

## 4b. Check for a stacked release

First check the unreleased range for a releasing commit: `git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD`.
If every commit is a non-releasing type (`refactor:`/`docs:`/`style:`/`chore:`/`test:` — no `feat`/`fix`/`!`/`BREAKING CHANGE`), release-please will cut nothing now; the work auto-batches until a `feat`/`fix` lands.
Say so in the final report and skip the batch-vs-release question.

Then apply the decision recorded in the early "Release coordination" section.
If that decision was to defer/batch: stop here — the push and CI are done; leave the issue open and skip steps 5–6.
Note the deferral in the final report.
Otherwise continue.

## 4c. Create planned follow-up issues

If the plan or its retro defers work to a follow-up issue ("created at ship time", "deferred to a follow-up"), create it now with `gh issue create` before closing — the shipped issue's close comment should reference its number.
Skip if the plan names no deferred follow-up.

## 5. Close the issue

Build the close comment from the commits since the shipped package's previous release.
Derive the previous tag package-scoped (`git tag --list '<pkg>-v*' --sort=-creatordate | head -1`, where `<pkg>` is the shipped package from the issue's plan path), not `git tag --sort=-version:refname | head -1`, which sorts lexically across all package tags and returns an unrelated package.

```bash
git log --oneline <pkg-tag>..HEAD
```

The comment should include:

- The commit hash that lands the change ("Implemented in <sha> …").
  Write the SHA as plain text — no backticks — so GitHub auto-links it to the commit.
- A short bullet list of feature/breaking commits.
- One sentence on user-visible behavior change.
- A note flagging any breaking change (matches `feat!:` commits).
- If the change unblocks or partially addresses other issues, mention them.

Then use `issue_close` with issue number `$1` and the summary as the comment.

Then check whether this push shipped work for **other** issues (a stacked refactor/enabler, other `(#M)` commit refs, or sibling `docs/plans/`/`docs/retro/` files in the `<pkg-tag>..HEAD` range).
Close each with its own short summary — release-please omits `refactor:` commits from the changelog, so a stacked refactor issue leaves no reminder.

## 6. Merge release-please PR (if present)

1. Use `release_pr_find` to locate an open release-please PR.
2. If none is found (timeout), skip to step 7.
3. If one exists, check which packages/versions the PR bumps.
   Read the **full** PR body — release-please collapses each package in a separate `<details>` block, so a truncated view hides sibling bumps.
   If it bumps a package unrelated to the issue being shipped, note it to the user before merging.
4. Use `release_pr_merge` with the PR number.
   - Note: release-please PRs typically have **no CI runs** because PRs created by the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not trigger workflows.
     This is expected; do not block on it.
   - If `release_pr_merge` returns an error (not mergeable), stop and report — let the user decide.
   - Exception: if it fails with `merge_state: UNSTABLE`, check `gh pr view <N> --json statusCheckRollup`.
     An empty rollup means no checks ran — the `GITHUB_TOKEN` case above; merge with `gh pr merge <N> --rebase` (matches the `defaultMergeMethod: rebase` config so the release lands as a linear commit, not a merge bubble), then `git pull --ff-only`.
     Stop and report only when the PR is genuinely blocked (`CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY`/`BEHIND` or a failing check).
5. Use `release_watch` to wait for the release tag to land on HEAD.

## 7. Final report

Print:

- The new HEAD on `main` (`git log --oneline -1`).
- The released version, if a release commit just landed (`git tag --points-at HEAD` or read `package.json`).
- Issue close confirmation.
- Anything that was skipped and why.

## Constraints

- Never force-push.
- Never merge a release-please PR that is genuinely blocked (`CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY`/`BEHIND` or a failing check); `UNSTABLE` from no checks running is the expected `GITHUB_TOKEN` case (step 6.4).
- If CI fails, the issue stays open.
- If multiple release-please PRs exist for the same component, stop and ask — that's a configuration issue, not a normal merge.
